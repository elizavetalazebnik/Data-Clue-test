          Artificial Intelligence is an ever-growing,{' '}
          <strong>revolutionary</strong> field of science and technology. It is
          arguably the next great leap for society to reach a new and profound
          level of <strong>advancement</strong>. Artificial Intelligence will
          affect our daily social interactions, the way we cure diseases, pursue
          interstellar travel, analyse our brains, and figure out just what kind
          of cheeseburger will most satisfy us at this very moment.
          <br />
          <br />
          Nevertheless, artificial intelligence is only ever as good as its
          <strong> creators</strong>. Behind all the machine learning and data
          are the subtle and intricate designs of a team that has carefully put
          together a new kind of <strong>brain</strong>. Firms and companies the
          world over have the power and resources to make massive projects with
          server farms and the latest computing technology to advance their AI
          goals. However, this can only go so far. It’s a matter of working
          <strong> smarter</strong> not harder. If the way your machine learns
          and processes information is fundamentally flawed or sloppily
          designed, all the resources in the world won’t compensate for it. True
          professionals, who are able and willing to tweak and alter the
          algorithms and fundamentals to make it more efficient, are far more
          worthy <strong>investments</strong>. The giant company that pumps
          their flawed designs with more computing power are doomed to only see
          their mistakes on a greater scale.
          <br />
          <br />
          Consider this most recent <strong>World Cup tournament</strong>. AI
          researchers at Goldman Sachs, German Technische University of
          Dortmund, Electronic Arts, Perm State National Research University,
          and others all ran machine learning models to <strong>predict</strong>{' '}
          the outcomes of several matches including the finals. The grand
          majority of them, despite all their resources, came up short with only
          Electronic Arts correctly predicting France’s championship. With
          hindsight, however, this makes sense. <strong>EA</strong> is a video
          game company famous for its soccer games. Their data, unlike their
          competition includes the most <strong>up-to-date</strong> ratings for
          players.
          <br />
          <br />
          Furthermore, their techniques for machine learning were designed to
          add as much <strong>realism</strong> to player performance as
          possible. Their designs take into account the smallest but no less
          essential factors, all specifically designed to understand every
          variable of a soccer match. Their{' '}
          <strong>specialisation and expertise</strong> were able to easily
          surpass the incredible power and resources of firms like Goldman
          Sachs.
          <br />
          <br />
          Sometimes the mistakes are far more glaring. Google photos can
          <strong> </strong> detect images with the same background and fuse
          them into one panoramic image. A Reddit User, “MalletsDarker,”
          attempted to use this machine learning feature by making Google images
          process three photos taken during a ski trip, two were landscapes and
          one was of his friend. Google images confidently merged the photos to
          create a breathtaking panorama of the ski resort.
          <br />
          <br />
          However, between two majestic mountains was the enormous profile of
          his friend’s head peering out of the woods, bigger than anything
          around him. It’s revealed that while Google had created an impressive
          algorithm for merging images, it failed to take into account the most
          fundamental basics of picture <strong>composition</strong>.
          <br />
          <br />
          Raw computing power and near-infinite resources to grow are nothing to
          shake a stick at. However, if you don’t have the experts who are
          willing to teak the intricacies of their AI, the results will{' '}
          <strong>always </strong>
          fall short.
