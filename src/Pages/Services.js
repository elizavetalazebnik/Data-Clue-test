            Firms have increasingly adopted and embedded algorithms into their
            operating models. This innovation has allowed companies to
            differentiate themselves in the market and improve the efficiency
            with which they provide goods and services to customers.
            <br />
            <br />
            Algorithms are now responsible for a whole host of applications,
            from targeting consumers with bespoke advertisements, through to
            product recommendations and filtering what content we see online (to
            name just a few).

                With these algorithms capable of processing vastly more data
                than before, and the ability to adapt to each unique interaction
                of an individual customer, the prospects for businesses to
                capitalise and take a competitive advantage in the market have

                With new and quickly evolving technology, regulations and
                guidelines are still developing, which created a challenging
                accountability, transparency and compliance landscape for
                algorithms.
                <br />
                <br />
                Our specialist Advanced Algorithm Development Team can help
                organisations with our range of development and assurance
                expertise in algorithm technology, risk management and coding
                skills. Our approach gives careful consideration to relevant
                regulatory requirements and industry standards and leverages of
                our proprietary algorithm control framework and validation
                methodologies, which we have developed while working across
                different industries and sectors.
                <br />
                <br />
                DataClue can assist organisations in identifying and
                understanding how they use their algorithms. We can also
                challenge related governance and oversight, examine the adequacy
                of algorithm policies and procedures, identify, manage and
                mitigate risks. Moreover, we can assess whether the control
                framework meets industry best practice, or relevant defined
                standards. Where needed, we will also support specific algorithm
                review activities, including code reviews, making use of our
                specialist coding teams across a range of programming languages.
